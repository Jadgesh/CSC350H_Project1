# Problem Statement and Background
* This project aims to create three variations of a card game on command line. The three variations are Tens, Elevens, and Thirteens. These three card games are very similar in the way they are played. You deal X amount of cards to the table and then remove cards that are in play depending on two factors. Factor 1: Select two card that adds up to the game's name (e.g 10, 11, 13). Factor 2: Select cards that meet an alternate condition(For 10s, Select 4 cards of the same Rank from 10 -> K (E.G Valid selection is K of ♦️, K of ♣️, K of ♠️, K of ♥️)| For 11s, Select a K, Q,and J | For 13s Select a K).
* The purpose of this project is to allow us to develop a functional piece of software from the ground up. We got our software prompted and were then instructed to think about what we'd need to make this software functional. We then created what we believed our initial UML design would be like. 
* This project also aims to show how drastically a project's structure can change when new features are added or hurdles are encountered.
